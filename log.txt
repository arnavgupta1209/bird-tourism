Clustering details:
Problems:
    High density Areas like kerela and low density like Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh
    Time taken

    Non-parametric vs parametric (shouldnt depend on n_clusters)

        Meanshift, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, OPTICS, Gaussian Mixtures(Bayenesian)(takes max_clusters)
    
    Inductive vs Transductive (Can work on some samples at a time)(n_samples)

    Single vs ensemble
        Tries to solve density problem
        
        tried to use mean shift twice, border areas(of first clusters) were issues

        tried to seperate out the states, border areas(goa and maharashtra) were issues

        trying to find a way to isolate high density areas and cluster them seperately

        Maybe do HDBSCAN then k-nearest(supervised on prev labels)

        Gaussian got andaman and nicobar right but has very uneven clusters also slow

3RD ROUND
CLUSTER SIKKIM AND HIMLAYAS AGAIN

TBD:
    BIRD ADDRESS (least priority rn)(very hectic)

    DISTANCE FILTER (essentially done)

    MULTI LOCAL (Would require big changes in analysis): have examples to help decide first:

        Aight we try it out on the top 100 people, I can give a score of how similar 2 clusters are in terms of count, so making two local clusters is easy enough
        This does not capture temporal changes, it does not capture anything apart from just count.

    GRAPH THEORY: (incorporating temporal) 
        Maybe have a before and after in each checklist, citing where the person was before it, and where they were after it.
        Store a list for each observer, a sequence of numbers according to the clusters theyve been in. find most common sub seq.
        Construct a personal graph for each observer based on seq.
        Wilder: Construct a markov chain for each observer (Should capture birder behaviour quite well, but not temporal issues like house change).

        GRAPHS HAVE BEEN MADE AND STORED.

    Defining tourism via graphs:
    connectivity + self birding
    Honestly, idk
    new prevailing theory, sliding window, see whats most popular in that window, window size?, maybe adaptive?

    28-05-2024
    Sliding window implemented, no major difference, but some graphs look more sensible

    Simulated a so called markov process

    Tried to open the tif files
